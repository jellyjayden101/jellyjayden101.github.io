        <h1>Why did he decide to do art?</h1>
        <p style="width: 900px; font-size: 17px;">For Michelangelo, art was a thing that Michelangelo did in most of his time because there wasnt much to do. Most of Michelangelo's sculptures feature the masculine body, allowing him to express his thoughts through the way of sculpture</p>

        <h1>The effect that on the Renaissance</h1>
        <p style="width: 900px; font-size: 17px;">In addition to having a significant impact on the classical Renaissance, Michelangelo's work greatly formed the art of the Mannerist era, the Counter-Reformation, and the Baroque. He created a brand-new anatomical drawing language that at least occasionally functioned as a significant model for the majority of painters of his day. </p>
