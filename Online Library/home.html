                <h1>Fact One - As of 2020, there are more gamers than ever</h1>
                <p>An estimated 2.7 billion people played video games in 2020 alone. This increase is likely due to the global pandemic, a wide supply, and an ever growing demand. Here's to the age of the gamer!</p>

                <h1>Fact Two - Video games have become a major spectator sport</h1>
                <p>It's no secret that Esports have exploded in recent years, but the extent of their popularity might surprise you. For the past several championships, the League of Legends world competition has drawn more viewers than the Super Bowl or NBA finals.</p>

                <h1>Fact Two - Gamers actually agree on the worst video game of all time</h1>
                <p>It was so bad, the creators buried the evidence. Literally. The Atari ET video game is widely regarded as the worst video game ever created, and years after it was created, copies were found buried in the New Mexico desert. If it truly was that bad, it seems like Atari ET got its just deserts. </p>
